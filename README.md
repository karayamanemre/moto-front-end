## MotoMate App

- MotoMate is a web application for managing motorcycles. Users can log in with their name, view available motorcycles, add or delete motorcycles, and make reservations for motorcycles. The application is built using React for the front-end, Rails for the back-end, and PostgreSQL as the database. The back-end database has been deployed to Heroku, while the front-end has been deployed to Firebase. [Back-end of this Project](https://github.com/karayamanemre/Moto-back-end)
